## Description

_ This code was created for an independent project at Epicodus. This is only javascript code. All functions and prototypes pass all tests and branches for a %100 coverage. There are prototypes to figure out peoples age on Mercury, Venus, Mars & Jupiter. Life expectancy is given at 77 which is the life expectancy of a male. If age is passed the expectancy, the output will be how many years passed the expectancy the person's age is. This will be a positive number._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* At https://github.com/DiamondsAndRust206/solar-age copy the repository URL named "solar-age". You can do this by clicking the green Code button and copy the URL from there.
* In a shell program, clone the copied repository to your desktop (git clone URL).
* Open the newly cloned directory named "solar-age."
* Navigate your terminal to the root directory of the project.
* Run "npm install" in your terminal. Then npm run build.
* By running "npm test" you will be able to test the business logic functions and prototypes.
